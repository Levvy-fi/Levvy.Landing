## Revenue Strategy

### Initial Distribution Phase (80/20 Split)

During the initial phase, distributions follow this model:

:::info Distribution Breakdown
- **80%** of profits → Distributed to holders
- **20%** of profits → Reinvested in treasury
:::

This applies to:
- ✅ All profits from yield farming
- ✅ Investment returns
- ✅ Low-risk trading profits
- ✅ ADA lending revenue
- ✅ 75% of Levvy platform fees

### Mature Phase (50/50 Split)

Once the initial $ANGELS sale value has been returned to holders:

:::success Enhanced Growth Model
- **50%** of profits → Distributed to holders
- **50%** of profits → Reinvested for accelerated growth
:::

This balanced approach will:
- Grow the treasury faster
- Increase monthly distributions
- Create compounding returns
- Ensure long-term sustainability

## Investment Philosophy

We believe in maximizing returns through strategic positioning in Cardano's DeFi ecosystem:

### Low-Risk Strategies

<div className="strategy-list">
  <div className="strategy-item">
    <h4>🌾 Yield Farming</h4>
    <p>Participating in vetted, stable yield farms with proven track records</p>
  </div>
  <div className="strategy-item">
    <h4>💸 ADA Lending</h4>
    <p>Lending ADA against less volatile assets with appropriate collateral ratios</p>
  </div>
  <div className="strategy-item">
    <h4>📊 Protected Trading</h4>
    <p>Executing low-risk trades with defined stop-losses and risk parameters</p>
  </div>
  <div className="strategy-item">
    <h4>🏦 Strategic Positions</h4>
    <p>Taking strong positions in top-tier Cardano tokens and protocols</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Monthly Distribution Process

### How It Works

1. **Hold $ANGELS** - Keep tokens in your wallet
2. **Qualify for Rewards** - Hold enough for at least 1 ADA in distributions
3. **Receive ADA** - Get airdropped on the 15th of each month
4. **No Staking Required** - Simple holding is sufficient

:::tip Distribution Day
Mark your calendar! Distributions happen on the **15th of every month**.
