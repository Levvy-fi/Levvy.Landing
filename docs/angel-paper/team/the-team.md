Meet the passionate individuals driving Angel Finance forward.

## Barachiel - The Angel of Blessings üåü

<div className="team-member">
  <div className="member-intro">
    <h3>Founder & Visionary</h3>
    <div className="member-story">
      <p>My crypto journey began in 2018 when I bought my first ETH at around $100. That moderate investment changed my life when ETH shot to over $4,000, enabling me to buy my first home.</p>
      
      <p>During those early days, I immersed myself in DeFi, yield farming, staking, and trading. The crypto space was the Wild West - filled with scams and rugs - but I was fortunate to learn through experience while navigating the minefield.</p>
      
      <p>After gaining extensive DeFi experience across multiple chains, I discovered Cardano in late 2020. It was a breath of fresh air - a bastion from the chaos of other chains and exactly what I'd been searching for.</p>
      
      <p>My positive experiences investing in Cardano's ecosystem led us to create Angel Finance. Today, we're building Levvy V3 to contribute something meaningful back to the community that has given us so much.</p>

## CMDR07 - Commander Jonathan

<div className="team-member">
  <div className="member-intro">
    <h3>Community Lead & Strategic Advisor</h3>
    <div className="member-story">
      <p>Hello everyone! I'm CMDR07, CMD, or Commander. My real name is Jonathan, and I hail from the Pacific Northwest.</p>
      
      <p>I joined Cardano in early 2021 after watching Charles's famous whiteboard video. I know it's clich√©, but it's true! The vision of real financial freedom and decentralization struck a chord with me, and I dove headfirst into the ecosystem.</p>
      
      <p>Since then, I've worn many hats: community member, moderator, project lead for Lurkers, game master, serial collaborator, and full-time community advocate. My belief is that the connections we make with people worldwide hold more value than any financial gains.</p>
      
      <p>I joined Angel Finance because I've witnessed the token landscape's ups and downs - the pumps, dumps, and community desire for real utility beyond "number go up." We're building true value without the fluff and negative stigma plaguing many tokens.</p>
      
      <p>My role encompasses community interaction, collaborations, ideation, implementation, and the essential tasks of supporting our community - from answering tickets to maintaining a safe, prosperous environment for all.</p>
      
      <p className="team-quote">This is the definition of a HODL project, and I look forward to realizing gains with all of you. May you be Blessed!</p>

## Defifomofo - Erik

<div className="team-member">
  <div className="member-intro">
    <h3>DeFi Strategist & Community Builder</h3>
    <div className="member-story">
      <p>I'm defifomofo - or defi, defimomo, mofo, fi-fi-fo-fum, or simply Erik. Currently residing in Ohio, I've lived across the eastern United States.</p>
      
      <p>My blockchain journey began in 2018 when a friend introduced me to Ethereum and smart contracts. The concept of digital assets and eliminating traditional banking intrigued me, though initial banking restrictions prevented immediate participation.</p>
      
      <p>In late 2020, another friend mentioned Cardano. After watching the Whiteboard video, I was hooked. I spent 2021 absorbing everything blockchain-related - from consensus models to tokenomics and security practices. Among all chains, Cardano consistently stood out.</p>
      
      <p>In late 2021, I discovered Cardano's NFT ecosystem (contrary to popular belief at the time!). I minted a CCVault Mesmerizer, grabbed a BlockOwl, and never looked back.</p>
      
      <p>I've always believed projects grow stronger through collaboration. While my early collaborative ideas didn't all materialize, the connections I made led to opportunities in moderation, social media promotion, and community building.</p>
      
      <p className="team-quote">I am truly Blessed to be part of Angel Finance. This project has the potential to positively impact our holders' lives, and I'll do everything in my power to ensure it does.</p>
