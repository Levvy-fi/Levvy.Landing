## Our Story

Angel Finance is an Angel-themed DeFi project on Cardano. What started as a small DeFi investment club in January 2024 has evolved into something much greater.

## The Levvy Transformation

When we purchased Levvy at the end of May 2024, we inherited a platform that ran on an off-chain centralized database. We knew this wasn't aligned with Cardano's principles of decentralization, so we made a bold decision:

:::info Major Achievement
We rebuilt the entire backend from scratch to work with live indexed transactions directly from the blockchain, making Levvy truly decentralized.
:::

This rebuild was resource-intensive but necessary. It also led us to partner with **SAIB**, a development team that has:
- Worked with the Cardano Foundation
- Contributed to Aiken
- Built numerous tools and infrastructure for Cardano

## Our Mission

Angel Finance aims to be an honest and hard-working contributor to the Cardano ecosystem. We're building sustainable DeFi products that provide real value to our holders.

### Key Objectives

1. **Return Value** - Return invested value back to holders through consistent distributions
2. **Passive Income** - Provide stable monthly ADA distributions
3. **Product Development** - Continuously develop new revenue-generating products
4. **Treasury Growth** - Grow the Angel Treasury to increase distributions over time

## Revenue Distribution Model

<div className="revenue-model">
  <div className="revenue-card">
    <h3>80% DeFi Profits</h3>
    <p>Distributed to $ANGELS holders monthly</p>
  </div>
  <div className="revenue-card">
    <h3>75% Levvy Revenue</h3>
    <p>Shared with the community</p>
  </div>
  <div className="revenue-card">
    <h3>20-25% Retained</h3>
    <p>Reinvested for growth</p>
  </div>
</div>

:::tip Distribution Schedule
All distributions happen on the **15th of every month**. To be eligible, simply hold $ANGELS in your wallet.

## Track Record

Since our launch in January 2024:
- âœ… **649,000+ ADA** earned and paid out to holders
- âœ… **Zero** team salaries taken
- âœ… **100%** commitment to holder value

## Looking Forward

Levvy V3 represents the culmination of everything we love about lending in crypto and more. The funds raised will be used to:

- Stabilize development costs for V3
- Provide liquidity to Cardano tokens
- Farm yield efficiently
- Lend ADA on stable assets
- Execute low-risk trading strategies

All profits from these activities flow back to $ANGELS holders, creating a sustainable cycle of value generation.
