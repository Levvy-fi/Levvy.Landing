# ⬅️ Borrowing

Learn how to access instant liquidity using your NFTs and tokens as collateral.

## Overview

Levvy offers borrowers the opportunity to access liquidity promptly through a competitive lending system. Lenders compete to provide the highest loan-to-value ratio (LTV), ensuring you get the best possible terms.

## How Borrowing Works

### 1. Collateral Locking
Once you accept a loan offer:
- Your tokens are locked to your stake key in the Levvy smart contract
- Assets remain secure in the smart contract until loan repayment
- You maintain ownership until the loan is repaid or foreclosed

### 2. Instant Disbursement
- Loan amount is sent to your wallet immediately
- No waiting periods or approval processes
- Transparent on-chain transactions

### 3. Repayment Options
- **On-time repayment**: Pay back loan + interest to unlock your collateral
- **Extension**: Negotiate new terms if you need more time
- **Default**: Failure to repay allows lender to foreclose on collateral
