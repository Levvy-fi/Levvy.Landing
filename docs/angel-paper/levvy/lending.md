## Understanding LTV (Loan-to-Value)

:::warning Critical Concept
LTV is the most important ratio in lending. We strongly advise all lenders to fully understand this concept before submitting offers.
:::

### What is LTV?
- **Definition**: The loan amount as a percentage of the asset's current value
- **Formula**: LTV = (Loan Amount / Asset Value) √ó 100
- **Risk Correlation**: Higher LTV = Higher Risk

### LTV Guidelines

<div className="ltv-guidelines">
  <div className="ltv-card safe">
    <h4>Conservative (40-60%)</h4>
    <p>Lower risk, suitable for volatile assets</p>
  </div>
  <div className="ltv-card moderate">
    <h4>Moderate (60-75%)</h4>
    <p>Balanced risk/reward for stable assets</p>
  </div>
  <div className="ltv-card aggressive">
    <h4>Aggressive (75%+)</h4>
    <p>Higher risk, requires close monitoring</p>
  </div>
</div>

## How Lending Works

### 1. **ADA Staking Continues**
- Your ADA remains staked to your pool until accepted
- Continue earning staking rewards
- No opportunity cost while waiting

### 2. **Loan Acceptance**
- When accepted, ADA is instantly sent to borrower
- Transaction approved through Levvy smart contract
- Your staking position transfers with the loan

### 3. **Loan Management**
- No predetermined expiration dates
- Monitor asset prices as LTV changes
- Option to foreclose on defaults

### 4. **Repayment**
- Receive principal + interest - fees
- Funds returned through smart contract
- No further obligations after repayment

## Important Considerations

### üìä Price Monitoring
After submitting offers:
- Watch token prices as they affect LTV
- Adjust offers if market conditions change
- Consider price volatility in your LTV calculations

### üéØ Asset Selection
- **Tokens**: Generally require lower LTV due to higher volatility
- **NFTs**: Can support higher LTV for established collections
- **Research**: Always investigate the asset before lending

### üíº Portfolio Strategy
- **Diversification**: Spread loans across multiple assets
- **Partial Fills**: Borrowers can take portions of your offer
- **No Matching**: Don't try to match exact borrower needs

      <li>Active management required</li>
      <li>Deep market knowledge needed</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Foreclosure Process

In case of loan default:
1. **Manual Initiation**: You must actively foreclose
2. **Collateral Receipt**: Receive the tokens/NFTs used as collateral
3. **Market Decision**: Choose to hold or sell the assets
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Ensure LTV covers potential losses

## Best Practices

:::tip Pro Tips for Lenders
1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with lower LTV ratios
2. **Monitor Markets**: Keep track of asset price movements
3. **Diversify Offers**: Spread risk across multiple loans
4. **Research Assets**: Understand what you're lending against
5. **Plan for Defaults**: Have a strategy for foreclosed assets
